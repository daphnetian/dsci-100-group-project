The database contains 76 attributes, but we will only categorize a subset of 5-10 of them, of which is already known to be common indication of heart disease. Additionally, only the Cleveland sub database will be used, as it is the only one only by ML researchers to this date. (Or try Hungary/Switzerland?)"
